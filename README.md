# PCOS-2D-to-3D-image-conversion
This project uses a trained ResNet-18 model to classify ovarian ultrasound images as normal or PCOS and converts each 2D ultrasound into a smoothed, color-mapped 3D point cloud for enhanced visualization. It allows doctors to view and analyze ultrasound structures in 3D, aiding research and diagnosis.
